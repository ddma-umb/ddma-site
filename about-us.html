				<br>

				This club was formed with with some big goals in mind. This is a club + intellectual space for UMass Boston's  <b class="bold-green"> designers, creatives, and artist, </b> where we can collectively establish a stronger understanding of usage of space, texture, color, and semiotics in visual/sensory medium to generate accessible, legible art and design in order to <b class="bold-green">create purposeful visual narratives.</b>
				<br>
				<br>

				Throughout the semester, we're going to have a series or individual and <a class ="link" href="">team projects</a>, assignments, and open critiques, <a class="link
				" href="schedule.html">workshops, and guest speakers. </a>
