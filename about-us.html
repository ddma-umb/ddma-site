				<h1> what are we? —</h1>
				<br>

				This club was formed to generate an intellectual space for UMass Boston's  <b class="bold-green"> designers, creatives, and artist, </b> where we can collectively establish a stronger understanding of usage of space, texture, color, and semiotics in visual/sensory medium to generate accessible, legible art and design in order to <b class="bold-green">create purposeful visual narratives.</b>
				<br>
				<br>

				Throughout the semester, we're going to have a series or individual and team projects, assignments, open critiques, and <a class="link
				" href="schedule.html">&nearr; workshops + guest speakers </a>

				<br>
				<br>


				<h2> no secrets — </h2>

				<br>
				The goal of these meetings and spaces are to further our creative abilities and knowledge, and create a  <a class="link" href="reading-list.html">&nearr; collective archive</a> of resources, in order to provide open-source access to tools that professional artists, designers, and students are using.

				<br>

				<h2> our places on the internet — </h2>

				<br>
				We also have social media accounts - 
				<a class="link" href="https://instagram.com/ddma.umb"> Instagram</a> 
				will be for promoting student work, announcing events, and discovering work from artists and designers we follow. We also use
				<a class = "link" href="https://www.are.na/ddma-umb"> Are.na </a> – Are.na is a platform for mood boarding and discovery - it's become an important part of creative process for many design studios.
